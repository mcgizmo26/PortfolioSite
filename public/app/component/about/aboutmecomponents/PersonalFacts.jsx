					<p>I am married and have four children. I enjoy hiking and want to mountaineer some day. I love soccer and am an avid Arsenal and Real Salt Lake supporter. I love gaming and play Destiny, Fifa and Titanfall on the Xbox One. I also love Star Wars and may or may not secretly be a Mandalorian.</p>
